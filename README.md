This repository contains all the code files and datasets related to the Data Mining Project on "California Wildfires Damage Prediction". 

The aim of this project is to analyze the damage caused by wildfires in California from 2013 to 2024 using R programming language. The dataset is provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) in collaboration with the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS). It is also made available on Kaggle for educational purposes.
